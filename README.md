# Problem Statement

Problem Statement: The challenge at hand involves a detailed examination of the multifaceted factors that exert an influence on student performance in academic tests. These factors encompass a spectrum of variables including but not limited to gender, ethnicity, lunch provision, engagement in test preparation, and parental educational background. The issue is of paramount significance as it directly impacts educational outcomes and the establishment of equitable learning environments.

Solution: In response to this challenge, a comprehensive machine learning project was undertaken. This initiative sought to meticulously identify and analyze the intricate interplay of the aforementioned factors within the context of student test performance. Leveraging a diverse dataset, the project employed sophisticated analytical techniques to discern patterns and correlations. The outcome of this endeavor is a repository of data-driven insights, which not only shed light on the individual and collective impacts of these factors but also provide a valuable resource for informing targeted educational strategies. Ultimately, this project serves as a catalyst for enhancing student outcomes and promoting inclusivity within the realm of education.

# Student Performance Indicator

The Student Performance Indicator project is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to analyze the impact of various variables on the test scores of students. By considering factors such as gender, ethnicity, lunch, test preparation, and parental level, this project provides insights into student performance.

Evaluate various machine learning models, such as KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, AdaBoostRegressor, SVR, LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, CatBoostRegressor, and XGBRegressor, to identify the model with the highest accuracy. In this project, Linear Regression is selected as the final model.

### Step 4: Data Ingestion

Implement data ingestion mechanisms to load and preprocess the dataset for model training and evaluation.

### Step 5: Pipeline Development for Data Transformation

Develop pipelines for data transformation to streamline the preprocessing steps and ensure consistent and efficient data handling.

### Step 6: Training and Evaluation of Linear Regression Model

Train the Linear Regression model using the preprocessed dataset and evaluate its performance against the test data.

### Step 7: Hyperparameter Optimization

Perform hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the Linear Regression model for improved accuracy and performance.

### Step 8: Prediction Pipeline and Web Application

Create a prediction pipeline with Flask to provide a user-friendly web application. The web app allows users to predict student performance based on criteria such as gender, ethnicity, lunch, test preparation, and parental level. The app is built using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap.

### Step 9: Deployment using AWS Cloud and CI/CD Pipelines

Deploy the project using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, leveraging CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment. This ensures seamless updates and scalability.
